Python program for optimizing the logistic discrimination gradient
descent algorithm. The program inputs  data file (data2.txt or datalogistic.txt) and training labels file (traininglabels2.txt or traininglogistic) respectively and outputs final gradient descent (w) and distance of plane to the origin with eta = 0.01 and stopping condition = 0.0000001.
