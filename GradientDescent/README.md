Python program that implements gradient descent for minimizing
the least squares loss. The program input a dataset file (data2.txt) and traininglabels file (traininglabels2.txt). As output the program gives final gradient descent (w) and distance of plane to the origin with eta = 0.001 and stopping condition = 0 or 0.001
