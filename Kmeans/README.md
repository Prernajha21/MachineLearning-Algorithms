Python program to output a k-means clustering. The program
have similar structure to the nearest means program.The input is a dataset and number of cluster k.
The output is in the format of label files.So if the clustering is C0 = {0, 2, 3}, C1 = {1, 4}
and C2 = {5} then the output would be

0 0
1 1
0 2
0 3
1 4
2 5
